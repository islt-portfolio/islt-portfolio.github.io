                        <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
                        <p>Pursuit of Excellence: Nutrition Ninja Edition is a trivia-style board game designed for 2-4 new customer service employees at a meal delivery company. I designed and developed all game components including the game board, question cards, rule book, and supporting materials like the Ninja Handbook reference guide. The game follows a Trivial Pursuit format where players move around a circular track collecting "belts" in six knowledge categories: value propositions, meals &amp; nutrition, ordering &amp; order types, billing &amp; payments, shipping &amp; delivery, and miscellaneous. Players must demonstrate mastery by correctly answering questions in each category, then advance to a final collaborative testing round where all players participate simultaneously. The rule book PDF serves as the primary artifact demonstrating my ability to create comprehensive instructional documentation that clearly communicates game mechanics, learning objectives, and collaborative procedures to facilitate effective implementation. My role encompassed instructional design decisions—determining learning objectives and assessment strategies—as well as all material production including game mechanics design, question development, and creation of comprehensive rule documentation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>Nutrition Ninja demonstrates several instructional approaches by integrating collaborative work, direct instruction, and student-centered learning with comprehensive performance support. Collaborative elements are a large part of gameplay as learners take turns asking each other questions from the cards; this requires cooperation and peer interaction, which facilitate learning. The final "Testing at the Dojo" round demonstrates collaborative learning where all players simultaneously answer the same questions and then engage in group discussion to evaluate answers, with majority consensus required for complex responses. Direct instruction occurs through the structured question-and-answer format and the Ninja Handbook reference materials that offer explicit guidance on company procedures. The game promotes student-centered learning through player agency: participants can choose movement direction, select question categories for miscellaneous spaces, and control the pace of their advancement through the knowledge domains. Performance support is built into the game structure via immediate feedback on answers, visual category coding, reference materials accessibility during play, and the allowance for reasonable consultation time with the Ninja Handbook during both regular and final rounds.</p>

                        <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
                        <p>Yes, Chef! is a 2-D educational game prototype created for new customer service employees built using the Construct 3 game engine. I handled all aspects of development including learner analysis, game design, asset creation, and programming implementation. The game features custom-designed backgrounds, character sprites, animated elements and interactive gameplay mechanics. The game was designed to introduce and then strengthen new customer service team members' knowledge of meal types and their macros. Team members need this knowledge to accurately answer customer questions about menu items and nutritional content. Level One requires players to identify the meal type and label it. Levels Two and Three weren't developed, but were designed to extend declarative knowledge into conceptual knowledge and included scoring that reflects increased understanding. My role encompassed both instructional design decisions— determining learning objectives and assessment strategies— and technical production work including digital art creation and game programming. This project served as the culminating assignment for IS_LT 7384 Designing Games for Learning, demonstrating the integration of educational theory with practical game development skills.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>Yes, Chef! promotes meaningful learning in an online environment by directly aligning game mechanics with authentic customer service skills that employees will use in their actual work environment. The progressive difficulty levels and scoring systems maintain engagement while ensuring players master essential competencies before advancing. I selected game-based learning technology for this artifact specifically because it allows for immediate feedback, repeated practice opportunities, and intrinsic motivation through scoring and achievement systems. The narrative structure and visual design elements create an engaging learning environment that encourages sustained participation and skill development.</p>

                        <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
                        <p>These project management artifacts from IS_LT 9473 demonstrate my ability to conduct systematic project planning across the complete lifecycle of instructional design implementation. My hypothetical Educational Technology Conference project includes a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that organizes complex deliverables into manageable components, from initial stakeholder analysis through post-event evaluation. The accompanying Gantt chart maps critical dependencies between project phases and establishes realistic timelines for each milestone. I developed these artifacts by conducting thorough needs analysis to identify stakeholder requirements; resource analysis to determine personnel and budget needs; and risk analysis to anticipate potential challenges. Using SmartSheet software, I created visual representations that would guide an actual implementation team through systematic project execution from conception to completion.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>Creating the WBS initially felt straightforward since I had strong planning skills; still, extending it into a functioning Gantt chart with accurate dependencies was daunting. The process taught me that effective project management requires understanding how individual tasks interconnect and impact overall project timelines. Working with SmartSheet illustrated both the power and limitations of dedicated project management software; while it automated calculations and provided clear visual tracking, it was also finicky about capturing precise timing details that would have been helpful. Learning to approach a project systematically immediately benefitted my personal and professional projects— particularly risk management strategies that help identify potential problems before they derail progress. This experience showed me that project management isn't just organizational skill but analytical thinking applied to complex, multi-phase endeavors.</p>

                        <p>This before/after comparison showcases my evolution in digital media production and web design via two contrasting websites. The "before" example from IS_LT 7361, Introduction to Digital Media, demonstrates my first attempts at multimedia integration, featuring video demonstrations, audio narration, text explanations, and graphics about Apple's People Detection feature, hosted on a Google Site. The "after" example represents my current portfolio website built with HTML/CSS, demonstrating advanced technical production skills including responsive design, semantic markup, and comprehensive accessibility implementation. Both sites address the same fundamental challenge of creating accessible digital environments, but the comparison demonstrates significant growth in my ability to align technical execution and design principles. This progression illustrates my growth from basic multimedia assembly to sophisticated web development with intentional universal design implementation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>The comparison between these two projects demonstrates strong growth in technological production skills and universal design implementation. While my early Google Site did incorporate multiple media types, it also used inadequate color contrast, cramped layouts, hard-to-read fonts, and lacked alt text for images; this was a fair start for my very first class, but it also revealed the gap between understanding accessibility concepts and executing them effectively. My current HTML/CSS portfolio site shows mastery of technical production via correct semantic markup, responsive design principles, vetted color contrast ratios, and comprehensive accessibility features. This evolution spotlights a crucial learning insight: technical competency has to be paired with inclusive design thinking to create truly effective digital environments. The before/after comparison serves as evidence of my ability to critically evaluate my own work, identify technical shortcomings, and systematically improve both production skills and accessibility implementation.</p>

                        <p>The Performance Analysis Worksheet shows my approach to breaking down a complex customer service problem into measurable components. I identified root causes across multiple categories (performer, motivational, and environmental factors), and then quantified the relative impact of each issue. Based on that, I designed an ASK System prototype that directly addressed the identified performance gaps. The system focused on the specific information customers couldn't find (nutritional data, ordering processes, delivery timelines) and created targeted learning experiences using personas. The personas were derived from the analysis to make sure the solution matched actual user needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>Effective analysis requires more than just identifying problems; it demands systematic thinking about why those problems exist and how different factors interact. Working through the Performance Analysis framework forced me to dig deeper than surface-level complaints and determine whether issues stemmed from knowledge gaps, motivational problems, or environmental barriers. What surprised me was discovering that 45% of the customer confusion was actually due to knowledge deficits, rather than poor website design (as I'd initially guessed). Applying these analytical results to design the ASK System showed me how front-end analysis directly informs instructional decisions. Rather than guessing what customers needed, I could point to specific data. Because they struggled with ordering deadlines and nutritional information, that became the foundation for the system's learning outcomes and content structure. These artifacts demonstrate my ability to conduct systematic analytical methods and apply findings to instructional design solutions.</p>

                        <p>Our group worked to support teachers in the building of one of our team members. The school district she taught for had just adopted new ELA curriculum. Based on the results of a gap analysis administered to building faculty, it was evident the team responsible for introducing the new curriculum was not perceived as effective. The team in charge needed support, so we worked to build a Train the Trainers program. Part of that program included formative and summative surveys. My role was to build the surveys with team input and gather data for analysis of our program's efficacy. Working as a team to address the needs of the program while also honoring each group member's contributions was a challenge.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>These two artifacts demonstrate how crucial a systematic approach to assessment design is, especially around program evaluation and data-driven improvement. Building each of the surveys for our Train the Trainers program required a depth of analytical thinking about what we actually needed to measure versus what we were just curious about. Forcing us to align every question with specific learning outcomes and program goals taught me that effective assessment design isn't just about gathering feedback; it's about creating instruments that can genuinely inform improvements and demonstrate impact. Working through the complexities of survey construction— from ensuring neutral question phrasing to designing response scales that would generate actionable data— gave me insight to how much strategic thinking goes into evaluation design. This experience reinforced that assessment and evaluation aren't afterthoughts to tack on at the end of a program, but integral components that must be woven throughout the entire instructional design process from the very beginning.</p>

                        <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
                        <p>Demonstrating ethical and inclusive data collection practices, these artifacts combine formal IRB training with practical application in ethical data collection via survey design. As part of my Research Methods coursework, I completed introductory training through CITI, which gave me a solid introduction to the rigors of ethical research. The training covered informed consent, privacy protection, and inclusive sampling methods. I applied these ethical frameworks when designing and implementing a survey examining teachers' technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic. I managed all aspects of the survey from initial question development through data collection protocol design in Qualtrics.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>This project required me to navigate ethical considerations around privacy, survey accessibility, and inclusive sampling methods in educational research contexts. These artifacts effectively demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. The CITI training offered a foundation in how to protect participants' rights as well as how to ensure inclusive research practices. The survey project gave me the chance to apply these principles to real-world data collection, which allowed me to evaluate the merits of pursuing my research question. In analyzing survey-takers' feedback, one participant requested a clearer explanation of a self-contained vs. departmentalized classroom. If I were to repeat this project, I would: offer more clarity around specialized terminology; spend more time considering diverse user perspectives during planning; consider exploring lighter-weight options like Google Forms for better accessibility. An openness to feedback, paired with reflection, offers a solid approach to growth and learning; both are essential to honest, thorough research.</p>

                        <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
                        <p>This before/after comparison showcases my evolution in digital media production and web design via two contrasting websites. The "before" example from IS_LT 7361, Introduction to Digital Media, demonstrates my first attempts at multimedia integration, featuring video demonstrations, audio narration, text explanations, and graphics about Apple's People Detection feature, hosted on a Google Site. The "after" example represents my current portfolio website built with HTML/CSS, demonstrating advanced technical production skills including responsive design, semantic markup, and comprehensive accessibility implementation. Both sites address the same fundamental challenge of creating accessible digital environments, but the comparison demonstrates significant growth in my ability to align technical execution and design principles. This progression illustrates my growth from basic multimedia assembly to sophisticated web development with intentional universal design implementation; my sharpened skill set is supported by accessibility ratings from WAVE and Chrome's Lighthouse accessibility extension.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Meeting the Competency &amp; Reflection</h3>
                        <p>The comparison between these two projects demonstrates strong growth in technological production skills and universal design implementation. While my early Google Site did incorporate multiple media types, it also used inadequate color contrast, cramped layouts, hard-to-read fonts, and lacked alt text for images; this was a fair start for my very first class, but it also revealed the gap between understanding accessibility concepts and executing them effectively. My current HTML/CSS portfolio site shows mastery of technical production via correct semantic markup, responsive design principles, vetted color contrast ratios, and comprehensive accessibility features as demonstrated by the accessibility reports. This evolution spotlights a crucial learning insight: technical competency has to be paired with inclusive design thinking to create truly effective digital environments. The before/after comparison serves as evidence of my ability to critically evaluate my own work, identify technical shortcomings, and systematically improve both production skills and accessibility implementation.</p>
